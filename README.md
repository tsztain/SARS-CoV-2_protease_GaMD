# SARS-CoV-2_protease_GaMD
GaMD simulation data, pocket analysis, and HTVS starting from PDB ID 6LU7 

### Structures from 2.5 us aggregate GaMD simulations can be found in the folder "Pockets"

File naming convention follows:

chain A distal site volume _ chain B distal site volume _ chain A active site volume _ chain B active site volume _ interface volume _ rms cluster number.pdb for dimers, 
and distal site volume _ active site volume _ rms cluster number.pdb for monomers 

Pocket volume units in (Ã…)<sup>3</sup>

### Hight throguhput virtual screen results can be found in the folder "HTVS"

For the three regions screened: distal, active, interface, the results are named as follows:

monomer / dimer _ apo / _ region _ chain _ rms cluster number _ HTVS.maegz

Simulation methods are described in this manuscript below
